# CodeForVegas

CodeForVegas is a non-profit located in (believe it or not) Las Vegas, NV. With a bit of inspiration from the co-founder, I've decided to spend a bit of my free time helping as a full-stack web developer.

## Plans

As of June 29th, 2022, I intend to build out the CodeForVegas.org landing page using HTML, CSS & JS. More functionality (i.e. integrated calendar with all CodeForVegas events) will be research and added in the future. 
*This section is expected to be changed as new plans arise*
